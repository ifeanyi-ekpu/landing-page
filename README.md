# WriteWave Landing Page

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundations Course**. The goal was to build a complete landing page based on a given design. This really helped me practice my HTML structure and use CSS Flexbox to make different parts of the page sit exactly where I wanted them.

The page is a mock-up for a made-up writing service called "WriteWave" (ignore the lack of creativity in the namingðŸ™ˆ).

## What I Built (Features)

* **Header:** At the top, with the company logo and navigation links to other parts of the page.
* **Hero Section:** The main eye-catching area, with a big title, some descriptive text, a "Get Started" button, and a nice image.
* **Information Section:** A section explaining why clients should choose WriteWave, with four individual boxes each having an icon and a short description.
* **Quote Section:** A place to show a client testimonial, with a quote and who said it.
* **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section:** A section encouraging visitors to "Hire a Writer" with a clear button.
* **Footer:** The very bottom of the page, with copyright information.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the page.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling and layout.
    * I especially focused on using **Flexbox** to arrange elements, like putting things side-by-side or stacking them neatly.
* **Google Fonts:** Used the `Roboto` font for the text.

## How to See It

You can view this project directly in your web browser. Just open the `index.html` file! (assuming you forked the project, right?)

## My Learning Journey

This project was a great challenge to put together everything I've learned about HTML and CSS. I spent a lot of time on:

* Making sure my HTML was organized cleanly.
* Understanding how `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `gap` work together to create complex layouts.
* Getting different sections to look good and spaced out correctly.

It wasn't always easy, but I learned a lot by trying things out and seeing how different CSS properties affected the page. I still believe it needs improvement (eg. making the page responsive), but that will come later when I learn it in coming lessons.
